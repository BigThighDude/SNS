Exercise 1: a list of a specified length with randomly generated elements is created. The list is passed to a function which uses the built in list.sort() function to order the list, where the function returns the [-1] indexed value ie. the maximum value.

Exercise 2: 2 functions are written. 1 is a recursive function, the other iterative. a user entered number is passed to both of these functions to show that they produce identical results.

Chapter 6

Exercise 1: a wireshare output file is opened as a csv and read into a dictreader object. user input determines which record number and which attributes of the record will be printed.

Exercise 2: The same wireshark file is opened and processed to remove all the non-TCP communications. Each record is then compared in the fields of ip source, ip destination, tcp source and tcp destination to determine the number of flows ie. unique communications. Each flow is printed alongside the total size in bytes.
